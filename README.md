# 🚨 Kavach: Advanced CCTV Analytics Solution 📹

Welcome to Kavach, our cutting-edge CCTV Analytics Solution! 🌟 This project harnesses the power of machine learning to transform live CCTV feeds into a proactive crime prevention tool. Using the state-of-the-art YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection framework, we're pushing the boundaries of public safety technology. 🛡️💻

## 🚀 Key Features

- **🕵️‍♂️ Incident Detection**: Our AI automatically identifies potential criminal activities in real-time.
- **🚓 Alert Generation**: Instantly notifies the nearest Police Station when incidents are detected.
- **🎯 YOLO Integration**: Utilizes YOLOv5 for fast and accurate object detection.
- **📊 Data Analysis**: Processes CCTV footage for insightful crime pattern analysis.

## 🏆 Project Achievement

Developed for Kavach 2023, we're proud to have achieved 1st place in the Internal Hackathon! This solution represents our commitment to enhancing public safety through innovative technology. 🥇

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**: The core language powering our solution.
- **YOLOv5**: State-of-the-art object detection for real-time video analysis.
- **OpenCV**: For advanced image processing and computer vision tasks.
- **PyTorch**: Driving our deep learning models.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Chirag30Sharma/Kavach-Advanced-CCTV-Solution.git
   cd Kavach-Advanced-CCTV-Solution
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## 📊 Usage

1. Ensure your CCTV feed is properly configured.
2. Launch the application to start real-time monitoring.
3. The system will automatically detect and alert on potential incidents.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Video Input**: Live CCTV feeds are processed in real-time.
2. **Object Detection**: YOLOv5 identifies people and objects in each frame.
3. **Behavior Analysis**: Our models analyze detected objects for suspicious activities.
4. **Alert Generation**: Potential threats trigger immediate alerts to authorities.

Let's work together to make our communities safer, one frame at a time! 🌆🔒

Remember, with great power comes great responsibility. Use this technology ethically and responsibly. Stay safe! 🦸‍♂️🦸‍♀️
